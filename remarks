# Style file (implementation questions)

Why use url.sty and not just hyperref? Is it a matter of taste or does it really
add features?

Looks like the \@tildeORI things is now useless, is it?

Why save \pageref at the beginning?

mylayout.sty ? fancy.sty ?

# Style file (features)

Using mirror.ctan.org to make clickable CTAN: urls (see \CTAN)

Using ctan.org/pkg/PKGNAME as link for package names (see \package and \pai).

# Style file (implementation)

Use fancyvrb + active chars for lscommand and code environments.

New command \changelabels for descriptions.

New \tti and \tth commands for things in tt in index.

# things.tex

202: add 'this file is refered to as the "source file", or simply "source"'?

250: why not advertise \textbackslash by textcomp? Shifting to math mode for
anything else but math is a bad habit (\everymath, \mathsurround, etc).

450 & Co: why not simply consider pdflatex as the normal compilation mode.
Everyone knows how to view a pdf... And anyway nearly everyone will consider
only the pdf as the final result (even pstricks addicts generally agree that
dvi/ps are just intermediate steps).

454: AFAIK, yap only works with MikTeX but you can also have TeX Live on windows
(which unfortunately doesn't come with a dvi viewer).

464: Actually dvipdf comes with GhostScript. Only (x)dvipdfm(x) come with the
TeX distro. Anyway, this is another point that make me think pdflatex should be
introduced instead: all those new commands and file formats look so scary to a
newcomer.

511: Why not advertise beamer?

602: texdoc is specific to teTeX and TeXLive (hence MacTeX), not really to Unix
(TeXLive exsists on windows). And MikTeX provides a similar thing named mthelp,
worth mentionning.

609 etc: every decent distro comes with the doc compiled, and the CTAN holds a
pdf version of every packages's doc (or is trying to). So I would just mention
doc.pdf etc, remember texdoc/mthelp, and say nothing about compiling dtx.

721: here too, mention pdf as well as dvi.
