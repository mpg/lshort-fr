This branch contains previous work started a while ago by me (Manuel
Pégourié-Gonnard) and imported from my private svn repo. Roughly speaking, I
updated the translation up to section 2.4 included, to match v4.24, and made
various updates to the macro files (sometimes not matching the upstream
version).

This branch is for reference only, it is NOT intended to be merged into the
'french' branch (no common ancestor, different directory structure, etc.).

I was using svn-multi, which is obviously pointless in a git context. Moreover,
I was defining \svntoday, which was later included in svn-multi. Besides this
error, the source still compiles fine using an up-to-date TL'08.

Besides comparing the few things I had done with Samuel's complete an more
up-to-date version (and perhaps importing a few interesting macro changes), the
only interesting file in this branch will be 'remarks'. This files holds various
remarks about things I changed (improved, I hope) in my French version.
It was intended to be sent to Tobias when ready, so that he could take them into
account for future upstream versions if he'd like to.

Maybe I'll add a TODO.mpg with various ideas for improvements I already talk
about with Samuel by private email some day.
