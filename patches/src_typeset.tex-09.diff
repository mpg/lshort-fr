+\subsection{Support for Portuguese}

+\secby{Demerson Andre Polli}{polli@linux.ime.usp.br}
+To enable the hyphenation and change all automatic text to \wi{Portuguese}
+\index{Portugu\^es} use the command:
+\begin{lscommand}
+\verb|\usepackage[portuges]{babel}|
+\end{lscommand}
+
+However, it's necessary to enable the accents used in portuguese, with the
+commands
+\begin{lscommand}
+\verb|\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}|
+\end{lscommand}
+and
+\begin{lscommand}
+\verb|\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}|
+\end{lscommand}
+
+Now, you can type normally all the accents used in the portuguese language.
+See the table~\ref{portuguese} to the preamble to write in portuguese language.

+\subsection{Support for French}

+\secby{Daniel Flipo}{daniel.flipo@univ-lille1.fr}
+Some hints for those creating \wi{French} documents with \LaTeX{}. 
+You can load French language support with the command:
+
+\begin{lscommand}
+\verb|\usepackage[frenchb]{babel}|
+\end{lscommand}
+
+Mind that, for historical reasons, the name of \textsf{babel}'s option 
+for French is either \emph{frenchb} or \emph{francais} but not \emph{french}.
+
+This enables French hyphenation, if you have configured your
+LaTeX system accordingly. It also changes all automatic text into
+French: \verb+\chapter+ prints Chapitre, \verb+\today+ prints the current
+date in French and so on. Further a set of new commands
+becomes available which allows you to write French input files more
+easily. Check out table \ref{cmd-french} for inspiration. 
+
+\begin{table}[!htbp]
+\caption{Special commands for French.} \label{cmd-french}
+\begin{lined}{9cm}
+\selectlanguage{french}
+\begin{tabular}{ll}
+\verb+\og guillemets \fg{}+         \quad &\og guillemets \fg \\[1ex]
+\verb+M\up{me}, D\up{r}+            \quad &M\up{me}, D\up{r}  \\[1ex]
+\verb+1\ier{}, 1\iere{}, 1\ieres{}+ \quad &1\ier{}, 1\iere{}, 1\ieres{}\\[1ex]
+\verb+2\ieme{} 4\iemes{}+           \quad &2\ieme{} 4\iemes{}\\[1ex]
+\verb+\No 1, \no 2+                 \quad &\No 1, \no 2   \\[1ex]
+\verb+20~\degres C, 45\degres+      \quad &20~\degres C, 45\degres \\[1ex]
+\verb+\bsc{M. Durand}+              \quad &\bsc{M.~Durand} \\[1ex]
+\verb+\nombre{1234,56789}+          \quad &\nombre{1234,56789}
+\end{tabular}

+\end{lined}
+\end{table}
+
+You will also notice that the layout of lists changes when switching to the
+French language. To get a full knowledge of what the \texttt{frenchb}
+option of \textsf{babel} does and how you can customize it's behaviour, run
+\LaTeX{} on file \texttt{frenchb.dtx} and read the produced file
+\texttt{frenchb.dvi}.
