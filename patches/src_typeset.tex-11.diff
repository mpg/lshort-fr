+\subsection{Support for Cyrillic}
+
+\secby{Maksym Polyakov}{polyama@myrealbox.com}
+Version~3.7h of \pai{babel} includes support for the
+\fei{T2*}~encodings and for typesetting Bulgarian, Russian and
+Ukrainian texts using Cyrillic letters.  
+
+Support for Cyrillic is based on standard \LaTeX{} mechanisms through 
+the \pai{fontenc} and \pai{inputenc} packages. But, if you are going to
+use Cyrillics in math mode, you need to load \pai{mathtext} package
+before \pai{fontenc}:\footnote{If you use \AmS-\LaTeX{} packages, 
+load them before \pai{fontenc} and \pai{babel} as well.}
+\begin{lscommand}
+\verb+\usepackage{mathtext}+\\
+\verb+\usepackage[+\fei{T1}\verb+,+\fei{T2A}\verb+]{fontenc}+\\
+\verb+\usepackage[+\iei{koi8-ru}\verb+]{inputenc}+\\
+\verb+\usepackage[english,bulgarian,russian,ukranian]{babel}+
+\end{lscommand}
+
+Generally, \pai{babel} will authomatically choose the default font encoding,
+for the above three languages this is \fei{T2A}.  
+However, documents are not restricted to a single font encoding.
+For multi-lingual documents using Cyrillic and Latin-based languages
+it makes sence to include latin font encoding explicitly. \pai{babel} 
+will take care of switching to necessary font encoding when a different language 
+is selected within the document.
+
+In adition to enabling hyphenations, translating automatically
+generated text strings, and activating some language specific 
+typographic rules (like \ci{frenchspacing}), \pai{babel} provides some 
+commands allowing typesetting according to the standards of 
+Bulgarian, Russian, or Ukrainian languages. 
+
+
+For all three languages, language specific punctuation is provided:
+cyrillic dash for the text (it is little narrower than latin dash and
+surrounded by thin spaces), dash for direct speech, quotes, and
+commands to facilitate hyphenation, see Table~\ref{Cyrillic}.

+   \verb|"--*| & Cyrillic emdash for denoting direct speech.         \\

+               (for compound words with hyphen, e.g.\ |x-""y|
+               or some other signs  as ``disable/enable'').     \\

+   \verb|"`| & for German left double quotes
+               (looks like ,\kern-0.08em,).                     \\
+   \verb|"'| & for German right double quotes (looks like ``).       \\%''

+
+The Russian and Ukrainian options of \pai{babel} define the commands \ci{Asbuk}
+and \ci{asbuk}, which act like \ci{Alph} and \ci{alph}, but produce capital
+and small letters of Russian or Ukrainian alphabets (whichever is the
+active language of the document). The Bulgarian option of \pai{babel} 
+provides the commands \ci{enumBul} and \ci{enumLat} (\ci{enumEng}), which
+make \ci{Alph} and \ci{alph} produce letters of either
+Bulgarian or Latin (English) alphabets. The default behaviour of
+\ci{Alph}  and \ci{alph} for the Bulgarian language option is to
+produce letters from the Bulgarian alphabet. 
+
+%Finally, math alphabets are redefined and  as well as the commands for math
+%operators according to Cyrillic typesetting traditions.
