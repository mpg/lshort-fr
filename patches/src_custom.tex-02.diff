 In this example, I am using both a new environment called
-\ei{lscommand} which is responsible for drawing the box around the

+\ei{lscommand}, which is responsible for drawing the box around the
+command, and a new command named \ci{ci}, which typesets the command
+name and makes a corresponding entry in the index. You can check

 of this book, where you'll find an entry for \ci{dum}, pointing to
 every page where I mentioned the \ci{dum} command.
