 \section{Overview}
 
-The \ei{picture} environment allows programming pictures directly in \LaTeX. 
-A etailed description can be found in the \manual.
-On the one hand, there are rather severe constraints, as the slopes of line segments 
-as well as the radii of circles are restricted to a narrow choice of values. 
-On the other hand, the \ei{picture} environment of \LaTeXe\ 
-brings with it the \ci{qbezier} command, ``\texttt{q}'' meaning ``quadratic''. 
-Many frequently used curves such as circles, ellipses, or catenaries can be 
-satisfactorily approximated by quadratic B\'ezier curves, although this may 
-require some mathematical toil. If, in addition, a programming language like Java 
-is used to generate \ci{qbezier} blocks of \LaTeX\ input files, the \ei{picture} 
-environment becomes quite powerful.

 Although programming pictures directly in \LaTeX\ is severly restricted,
 and often rather tiresome, there are still reasons for doing so. The documents
