 \subsection{The Fonts}
 
 \wi{pdf\LaTeX} can deal with all sorts of fonts (PK bitmaps, TrueType,
-PostScript type~1\dots) but prime \LaTeX{} font format, the bitmap PK
+\PSi{} type~1\dots) but prime \LaTeX{} font format, the bitmap PK
 fonts produce very ugly results when the document is displayed
-with Acrobat Reader. It is best to use PostScript Type 1 fonts
+with Acrobat Reader. It is best to use \PSi{} Type 1 fonts
 exclusively to produce documents that display well.
 
-We have not yet talked about fonts in this book because \LaTeX{}
-handles this on its own just fine, as it uses its own set of fonts well
-adapted to the requirements of scientific publishing.
-Actually, there are two sets of \TeX{} fonts: 
-\emph{Computer Modern} (CM), consisting of 128 characters, which is the
-default font set, and \emph{Extended Cork} (EC), made up from 256
-characters. The speciality of the EC font set is that it contains
-special characters for all the language-specific accented characters
-used in European languages, such as
-\"a or \`e. This allows hyphenation to work properly with words
-that contain such special characters. You can enable the EC character
-set by putting the command \verb+\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}+ into the
-preamble of the document (see page \pageref{fontenc}).
-Unfortunately, there is no free set of PostScript type~1 fonts
-for the EC character set. Fortunately, there are two ways to cheat.
+The \PSi{} Type 1 implementation of the Computer Modern and AMSFonts
+was produced by Blue Sky Research and Y\&Y, Inc., who then transferred
+copyright to the American Mathematical Society. The fonts were made
+publicly available in early 1997 and currently come with most of \TeX{}
+distributions. 
+
+However, if you are using \LaTeX{} to create documents in languages 
+other than English, you might want to use EC, LH, or CB fonts (see the
+discussion about \texttt{OT1} fonts on the page~\pageref{OT1}). 
+Vladimir Volovich has created the cm-super font bundle which covers the
+entire EC/TC, EC Concrete, EC Bright and LH font sets. It is available from
+\texttt{CTAN:/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super} and is included with \TeX{}Live7
+and Mik\TeX. Similar type~1 CB Greek fonts created by Apostolos
+Syropoulos are available at \texttt{CTAN:/tex-archive/fonts/greek/cb}.
+Unfortunately, both of these font sets are not of the same typographic
+quality as the Type1 CM fonts by Blue Sky/Y\&Y. They were automatically
+hinted, and the document might look   as neat on  the screen as the ones using
+Blue Sky/Y\&Y type 1 CM fonts, on high resolution output devices they
+produce results identical to the original bitmap EC/LH/CB fonts. 
+
+If you are creating document in one of Latin-based languages, you have
+several other options. 
 \begin{itemize}
-\item You can put the line \verb+\usepackage{aeguill}+\paih{aeguill} into the
-  preamble of your document, to use AE virtual fonts. 
-\item You can use \verb+\usepackage{mltex}+, but this only works when
+\item You might want to use \pai{aeguill} package, aka
+  \emph{Almost European Computer Modern with Guillemets}. Just put the
+  line \verb+\usepackage{aeguill}+\paih{aeguill}  into the preamble of  
+  your document, to enable AE virtual fonts instead of EC fonts.  
+\item Alternatively, you can use \pai{mltex} package, but this only works when  
   your pdf\TeX{} has been compiled with the \wi{mltex} option.
 \end{itemize}
 The AE virtual fontset, like the {Ml\TeX} system, makes \TeX{} believe
-it has a full 256 character fontset at its disposal by creating the
-missing letters from characters available in the normal CM font, which
-exists in a PostScript type~1 variant. This has the big advantage that
-hyphenation works well in European languages. 
-The only disadvantage of this approach is that the artificial AE
-characters do not work with Acrobat Reader's 
-\texttt{Find} function, so you cannot search for words with accented
-characters in your final PDF file.
-
-Another solution is not to use the CM fontset, but to switch to other
-Postscript type~1 fonts. Actually, some of them are even included with
-every copy of Acrobat Reader. Because these fonts have different
-character sizes, the text layout on your pages will change. Generally
-it will use more space than the CM fonts, which are very space-efficient. 
-Also, the overall visual coherence of your document will
-suffer because Times, Helvetica and Courier (the primary candidates
-for such a replacement job) have not been designed to work in harmony in
-a single document as has been done for the Computer Modern fonts.
+it has a full 256 character fontset at its disposal by creating most of
+the missing letters from characters of the CM font and rearranging them
+in the EC order, this allows to use the excellent type 1 format CM
+fonts available on most systems. As the font now is in T1 encoding
+hyphenation will well in Latin-based European languages.  The only
+disadvantage of this approach is that the artificial AE characters do
+not work with Acrobat Reader's \texttt{Find} function, so you cannot
+search for words with accented characters in your final PDF file.
+
+For the Russian language a similar solution is to use C1 virtual fonts 
+available at \texttt{ftp://ftp.vsu.ru/pub/tex/font-packs/c1fonts}. 
+These fonts combine the standard CM type~1                                 
+fonts from Bluesky collection and CMCYR type~1 fonts from  Paradissa and
+BaKoMa collection, all available on CTAN. Because Paradissa fonts
+contain only Russian letters, C1 fonts are                                  
+missing other Cyrillic glyphs. 
+
+Another solution is to switch to other \PSi{} type~1 fonts.
+Actually, some of them are even included with every copy of Acrobat
+Reader. Because these fonts have different character sizes, the text
+layout on your pages will change. Generally it will use more space than
+the CM fonts, which are very space-efficient.  Also, the overall visual
+coherence of your document will suffer because Times, Helvetica and
+Courier (the primary candidates for such a replacement job) have not
+been designed to work in harmony in a single document as has been done
+for the Computer Modern fonts.
  
 Two ready-made font sets are available for this purpose:
 \pai{pxfonts}, which is based on \emph{Palatino} as its main text body font,
