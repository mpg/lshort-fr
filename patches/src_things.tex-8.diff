+\section{Files you might encounter}
+
+When you work with \LaTeX{} you will soon find yourself in a maze of
+files with various \wi{extension}s and probably no clue. Below there is a
+list telling about the various \wi{file types} you might encounter when
+working with \TeX{}. Please note that this table does not claim to be
+a complete list of extensions, but if you find one missing which you
+think is important, please drop a line.
+
+\begin{description}
+  
+\item[\eei{.tex}] \LaTeX{} or \TeX{} input file. Can be compiled with
+  \texttt{latex}.
+\item[\eei{.sty}] \LaTeX{} Macro package. This is a file you can load
+  into your \LaTeX{} document using the \ci{usepackage} command.
+\item[\eei{.dtx}] Documented \TeX{}. This is the main distribution
+  format for \LaTeX{} style files. If you process a .dtx file you get
+  documented macro code of the \LaTeX{} package contained in the .dtx
+  file.
+\item[\eei{.ins}] Is the installer for the files contained in the
+  matching .dtx file. If you download a \LaTeX{} package from the net,
+  you eeill normally get a .dtx and a .ins file. Run \LaTeX{} on the
+  .ins file to unpack the .dtx file.
+\item[\eei{.cls}] Class files define what your document looks
+  like. They are selected with the \ci{documentclass} command.
+\end{description}
+The following files are generated when you run \LaTeX{} on your input
+file:
+
+\begin{description}
+\item[\eei{.dvi}] Device Independent file. This is the main result of a \LaTeX{}
+  compile run. You can look at its content with a DVI previewer
+  program or you can send it to a printer with \texttt{dvips} or a
+  similar application.
+\item[\eei{.log}] Gives a detailed account of what happened during the
+  last compiler run.
+\item[\eei{.toc}] Stores all your section headers. It gets read in for the
+  next compiler run and is used to produce the table of content.
+\item[\eei{.lof}] This is like .toc but for the list of figures.
+\item[\eei{.lot}] And again the same for the list of tables.
+\item[\eei{.aux}] Another file which transports information from one
+  compiler run to the next. Among other things, the .aux file is used
+  to store information associated with crossreferences.
+\item[\eei{.idx}] If your document contains an index. \LaTeX{} stores all
+  the words which go into the index in this file. Process this file with
+  \texttt{makeindex}. Refer to section \ref{sec:indexing} on
+  page \pageref{sec:indexing} for more information on indexing.
+\item[\eei{.ind}] Is the processed .idx file, ready for inclusion into your
+  document on the next compile cycle.
+\item[\eei{.ilg}] Logfile telling about what \texttt{makeindex} did.
