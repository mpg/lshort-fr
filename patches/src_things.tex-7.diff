-\section{Files you might encounter}
-
-When you work with \LaTeX{} you will soon find yourself in a maze of
-files with various \wi{extension}s and probably no clue. Below there is a
-list telling about the various \wi{file types} you might encounter when
-working with \TeX{}. Please note that this table does not claim to be
-a complete list of extensions, but if you find one missing which you
-think is important, please drop a line.

-\begin{description}
-  
-\item[\wi{.tex}] \LaTeX{} or \TeX{} input file. Can be compiled with
-  \texttt{latex}.
-\item[\wi{.sty}] \LaTeX{} Macro package. This is a file you can load
-  into your \LaTeX{} document using the \ci{usepackage} command.
-\item[\wi{.dtx}] Documented \TeX{}. This is the main distribution
-  format for \LaTeX{} style files. If you process a .dtx file you get
-  documented macro code of the \LaTeX{} package contained in the .dtx
-  file.
-\item[\wi{.ins}] Is the installer for the files contained in the
-  matching .dtx file. If you download a \LaTeX{} package from the net,
-  you will normally get a .dtx and a .ins file. Run \LaTeX{} on the
-  .ins file to unpack the .dtx file.
-\item[\wi{.cls}] Class files define what your document looks
-  like. They are selected with the \ci{documentclass} command.
-\end{description}
-The following files are generated when you run \LaTeX{} on your input
-file:
-
-\begin{description}
-\item[\wi{.dvi}] Device Independent file. This is the main result of a \LaTeX{}
-  compile run. You can look at its content with a DVI previewer
-  program or you can send it to a printer with \texttt{dvips} or a
-  similar application.
-\item[\wi{.log}] Gives a detailed account of what happened during the
-  last compiler run.
-\item[\wi{.toc}] Stores all your section headers. It gets read in for the
-  next compiler run and is used to produce the table of content.
-\item[\wi{.lof}] This is like .toc but for the list of figures.
-\item[\wi{.lot}] And again the same for the list of tables.
-\item[\wi{.aux}] Another file which transports information from one
-  compiler run to the next. Among other things, the .aux file is used
-  to store information associated with crossreferences.
-\item[\wi{.idx}] If your document contains an index. \LaTeX{} stores all
-  the words which go into the index in this file. Process this file with
-  \texttt{makeindex}. Refer to section \ref{sec:indexing} on
-  page \pageref{sec:indexing} for more information on indexing.
-\item[\wi{.ind}] Is the processed .idx file, ready for inclusion into your
-  document on the next compile cycle.
-\item[\wi{.ilg}] Logfile telling about what \texttt{makeindex} did.
