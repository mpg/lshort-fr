-When using this package, you should consider

-Font encoding is a different matter. It defines at which position inside
-a \TeX-font each letter is stored. The original Computer Modern
-\TeX{} font only contains the 128 characters of the old 7-bit ASCII
-character set. When accented characters are required, \TeX{} creates
-them by combining a normal character with an accent. While the
-resulting output looks perfect, this approach stops the automatic
-hyphenation from working inside words containing accented characters.
-
-Fortunately, most modern \TeX{} distributions contain a copy of the EC
-fonts. These fonts look like the Computer Modern fonts, but contain
-special characters for most of the accented characters used in
-European languages. By using these fonts you can improve hyphenation
-in non-English documents. The EC fonts are activated by including the
-\pai{fontenc} package in the preamble of your document. \label{fontenc}
+If you use multilingual document with conflicting input encodings, 
+you might want to switch to unicode with the help of \pai{ucs} package. 
 
 \begin{lscommand}
-\ci{usepackage}\verb|[T1]{fontenc}| 
+\ci{usepackage}\verb|{ucs}|\\ 
+\ci{usepackage}\verb|[|\iei{utf8}\verb|]{inputenc}| 
 \end{lscommand}
+\noindent will enable you to create \LaTeX{} input files in 
+\iei{utf8}, a multi-byte encoding in which each character can be encoded in
+as little as one byte and as many as four bytes. 
 
-As of this writing, no free, high quality \textsc{PostScript} versions of the EC fonts are
-available.\footnote{Vladimir Volovich has created the cm-super font bundle
-which covers the entire EC/TC, EC Concrete, EC Bright and LH fonts. It is avalable from \texttt{CTAN:/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super} and is
-included with \TeX{}Live7 and Mik\TeX. Unfortunately these fonts are not
-of the same typographic quality as the normal Type1 renderings of the CM fonts} This causes problems when generating PDF versions of your
-documents---the resulting PDF file will look abysmal on screen. You might
-want to have a look at the \pai{aeguill} package, aka \emph{Almost European
-Computer Modern with Guillemets}, which uses the characters from the original Computer
-Modern font, but rearranges them in the EC order and can thus use the
-excellent type 1 format CM fonts available on most systems. There is also an \pai{ae} package, but it
-does not provide proper rendering of French quotes, aka guillemets (see the section
-on pdf\LaTeX{} on page \pageref{sec:pdftex}).
+Font encoding is a different matter. It defines at which position inside
+a \TeX-font each letter is stored. Multiple input encodings could be mapped into 
+one font encoding, which reduces number of required font sets.
+Font encodings are handled through 
+\pai{fontenc} package: \label{fontenc}
+\begin{lscommand}
+\ci{usepackage}\verb|[|\emph{encoding}\verb|]{fontenc}| \index{font encodings}
+\end{lscommand}
+\noindent where \emph{encoding} is font encoding. It is possible to load several
+encodings simultaneously.
+
+The default \LaTeX{} font encoding is \label{OT1} \fei{OT1}, the encoding of the
+the  original Computer Modern \TeX{} font. It containins only the 128
+characters of the 7-bit ASCII character set. When accented characters
+are required, \TeX{} creates them by combining a normal character with
+an accent. While the resulting output looks perfect, this approach stops
+the automatic hyphenation from working inside words containing accented
+characters. Besides, some of latin letters could not be created by
+combining a normal character with an accent, to say nothing about letters of
+non-latin alphabets, such as Greek or Cyrillic.
+
+To overcome these shortcomings, several 8-bit CM-like font sets were created.
+\emph{Extended Cork} (EC) fonts in \fei{T1} encoding contains 
+letters and punctuation characters for most of the European
+languages based on Latin script. The LH font set contains letters necessary
+to typeset documents in languages using Cyrillic script. Because of the large
+number of Cyrillic glyphs, they are arranged into four font
+encodings---\fei{T2A}, \fei{T2B}, \fei{T2C},
+and~\fei{X2}.\footnote{The list of languages supported by each of these
+encodings could be found in \cite{cyrguide}.} The CB bundle contains fonts
+in \fei{LGR} encoding for the composition of Greek text.
+
+By using these fonts you can improve/enable hyphenation in non-English
+documents. Another advantage of using new CM-like fonts is that they 
+provide fonts of CM families in all weights, shapes, and optically
+scaled font sizes.
