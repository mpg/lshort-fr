Translation process:

We will take the transition from v3.20 to v3.21 as an example. First,
generate all the hunks thanks to the script.

Then examine the non-translation related patches. Apply them, commit with a
relevant message (applied cosmetic changes of the transition). If there are
conflicts, keep the version done by the patch : it will help converge
towards the shape of the upstream version.

Then examine the changes to the *.sty files: if there are new macros or
changed macros, apply the patch plus all the patches using these macros. If
you can separate that into several commits, the better.

Finally, you are normally left with the pure translation patches : apply
them one by one.

IMPORTANT: for each commit, remember to delete the corresponding patch(es)
from the patches directory.

When all the patches have been deleted (i.e. they have all been applied or
translated), you are ready to reread the resulting document, maybe do a few
more changes translation-wise, and tag it as the new version (here v3.21-fr,
for instance).

This process might benefit from using quilt/guilt in the future.
