-It is quite difficult to get bold symbols in \LaTeX{}; this is
-probably intentional as amateur typesetters tend to overuse them.  The
-font change command \verb|\mathbf| gives bold letters, but these are
-roman (upright) whereas mathematical symbols are normally italic.
-There is a \ci{boldmath} command, but \emph{this can only be used
-outside mathematics mode}. It works for symbols too.
-\begin{example}
-\begin{displaymath}
-\mu, M \qquad \mathbf{M} \qquad
-\mbox{\boldmath $\mu, M$}
-\end{displaymath}
-\end{example}
-
-\noindent
-Notice that the comma is bold too, which may not be what is required.
-
-The package \pai{amsbsy} (included by \pai{amsmath}) as well as the
-\pai{bm} from the tools bundle make this much easier as they include
-a \ci{boldsymbol} command.
-\ifx\boldsymbol\undefined\else
-\begin{example}
-\begin{displaymath}
-\mu, M \qquad
-\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{M}
-\end{displaymath}
