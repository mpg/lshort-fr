+A much easier way to get graphics into a document is to generate them
 with a specialised software package\footnote{Such as XFig, CorelDraw!,
   Freehand, Gnuplot, \ldots} and then include the finished graphics
 into the document. Here again, \LaTeX{} packages offer many ways to do
-that. In this introduction, only the use of \wi{Encapsulated
-  PostScript} (EPS) graphics will be discussed, because it is quite
+this, but this introduction will only discuss the use of \wi{Encapsulated
+  PostScript} (EPS) graphics, because it is quite
 easy to do and widely used.  In order to use pictures in the EPS
 format, you must have a \wi{PostScript} printer\footnote{Another
   possibility to output PostScript is the \textsc{\wi{GhostScript}}
