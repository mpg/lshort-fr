-To create this type of document you normally work within the
-\texttt{article} class. Figure \ref{fig:pdfscr} shows an example input file.
-First you have to load the \pai{pdfscreen} package together with
-appropriate options:
-\begin{description}
-\item[\texttt{screen}] for screen presentation. Use \texttt{print} to
-  create a printable version.
-\item[\texttt{panelright}] put a navigation panel on the right side of
-  the screen. If the panel should be on the left side use
-  \texttt{panelleft}. If you do not want panels use \texttt{nopanel}.
-\item[\texttt{french}] or some other supported language will render
-  the text on the navigation buttons appropriately. This option is
-  independent of the options set with the babel package. If your language is not supported by \pai{pdfscreen}, 
-  you still can localize navigation panel buttons by using 
-  file \texttt{pdfscreen.cfg}, see \texttt{pdfscreen.cfg..specimen} for
-an example.
-\item[\texttt{chocolate}] color scheme for the navigation panel. Other
-  choices are \texttt{gray}, \texttt{orange}, \texttt{palegreen},
- \texttt{bluelace} and \texttt{blue}, which is the default.
-\end{description}
-Then you configure the display format. Because the presentation will
-always scale to the real size of the screen when displayed, this can
-be used to configure the overall font size:
-\begin{description}
-\item[\ci{panelwidth}] defines the width of the navigation panel
-\item[\ci{screensize}\textmd{\texttt{\{}\emph{width}\texttt{\}\{}\emph{height}\texttt{\}}}]
-  define the width and height of the screen including the navigation
-  panel.
-\item[\ci{marginsize}\textmd{\texttt{\{}\emph{left}\texttt{\}\{}\emph{right}\texttt{\}\{}\emph{top}\texttt{\}\{}\emph{bottom}\texttt{\}}}]
-  defines the margins of the document. In the example the document is
-  not centered because the section numbers are kept in the left
-  margin.
-\end{description}
-
-It is possible to use a background image in any of the image formats
-supported by pdf\TeX{} using the command
-\begin{lscommand}
-\ci{overlay}\verb|{|\emph{image}\verb|}|
-\end{lscommand}
-\noindent or if you prefer a plain background you can define its color using
-\begin{lscommand}
-\ci{background}\verb|{|\emph{color}\verb|}|
-\end{lscommand}
-Finally if you want to place the logo of your organization into the
-navigation panel use the command
-\begin{lscommand}
-\ci{emblema}\verb|{|\emph{logo}\verb|}|
-\end{lscommand}
+When you compile the code presented in figure \ref{fig:code-beamer}
+with \wi{PDF\LaTeX} you get a PDF file with a title page and a second page
+showing several items that will be reveled one at a time as you step
+though your presentation.
 
-If you believe in the presentational power of successive exposure of
-your bullet points you may want
-to make use of the \pai{pause} package. It provides the command
-\ci{pause}. You can place this command right into the flow of your
-text wherever you want Acrobat to pause the display of your document.
-The \pai{pause} package is part of the \texttt{ppower4} ($P^4$:
-\emph{Pdf Presentation  Post-Processor}) system, which can post-process
-pdf output from pdf\TeX{} and make it sing and dance and beg for
-food. On the command line it looks like this:
-\begin{lscommand}
-\verb+ppower4 xy.pdf xyz.pdf+
-\end{lscommand}
+One of the advantages of the beamer class is that it produces a PDF
+file that is directly usable without first going through a PostScript
+stage like \pai{prosper} or requiring additional post processing like
+presentations created with the \pai{ppower4} package.
 
-To control what goes onto a single slide, use the environment
-\verb+\begin{slide}+ \ldots \verb+\end{slide}+. The content of each
-slide will get displayed centered vertically on its page.
+With the \pai{beamer} class you can produce several versions (modes) of your
+document from the same input file. The input file may contain special
+instructions for the different modes in angular brackets. The
+following modes are available.
 
-Compiling the example above, will end in an error message:
-\begin{verbatim}
-! pdfTeX warning (dest): name{contents} has been
-  referenced but does not exist, replaced by a fixed one
-\end{verbatim}
-This is because there is a button in the navigation panel that wants
-to point to the table of contents, because this example does not
-contain a \ci{tableofcontents} command the resolution of the link
-fails.
-
-If you want the table of contents to be displayed right inside the
-navigation panel, you can use the option \texttt{paneltoc} when
-calling \pai{pdfscreen}. This will only produce satisfactory results
-if your presentation has very few and short entries in the table of
-contents. You may want to provide short titles for your section
-headings in square brackets.
-
-This short introduction only scratches the surface of what is
-possible with \pai{pdfscreen} and \texttt{PPower4}. Both come with
-their own extensive documentation.
+\begin{description}
+\item[beamer] for the presentation PDF
+  discussed above.
+\item[trans] for slides.
+\item[handout] for the printed version.
+\end{description}
+The default mode is \texttt{beamer}, you can change it by setting a
+different mode as a global option, like
+\verb|\documentclass[10pt,handout]{beamer}| to print the handouts for
+example.
+
+The look of the screen presentation depends on the theme you choose. You can either
+pick one of the themes shipped with the beamer class or you can
+even create your own. See the beamer class documentation in
+\texttt{beameruserguide.pdf} for more information on this.
+
+Lets have a closer look at the code in figure~\ref{fig:code-beamer}.
+
+For the screen version of the presentation \verb|\mode<beamer>| we
+have chosen the \emph{Goettingen} theme to show a navigation panel
+integrated into the table of contents. The options allow to choose the
+size of the panel (22~mm in this case) and its position (on the right
+side of the body text). The option \emph{hideothersubsections}, shows
+the chapter titles, but only the subsections of the present
+chapter. There are no special settings for \verb|\mode<trans>| and
+\verb|\mode<handout>|. They appear in their standard layout.
+
+The commands \verb|\title{}|, \verb|\author{}|, \verb|\institute{}|,
+and \verb|\titlegraphic{}| set the content of the title page. The
+optional arguments of \verb|\title[]{}| and \verb|\author[]{}|
+let you specify a special version of the title and the author
+name to be displayed on the panel of the \emph{Goettingen} theme.
+
+The titles and subtitles in the panel are created with normal
+\verb|\section{}| and \verb|\subsection{}| commands that you place
+\emph{outside} the \ei{frame} environment.
+
+The tiny navigation icons at the bottom of the screen also allow to
+navigate the document. Their presence is not dependent on the theme
+you choose.
+
+The contents of each slide or screen has to be placed inside a
+\ei{frame} environment. There is an optional argument in angular
+brackets (\verb|<| and \verb|>|), it allows to suppress a particular
+frame in one of the versions of the presentation. In the example the
+first page would not be shown in the handout version due to the
+\verb|<handout:0>| argument.
+
+It is highly recommended to set a title for each slide apart from the
+title slide. This is done with the command \verb|\frametitle{}|. If a
+subtitle is necessary you can use the \ei{block} environment as shown
+in the example. Note that the sectioning commands \verb|\section{}|
+and \verb|\subsection{}| do not produce output on the slide proper.
+
+The command \verb|\pause| in the itemize environment lets you reveal
+the items one by one. For other presentation effects check out the
+commands \verb|\only|, \verb|\uncover|, \verb|\alt| and
+\verb|\temporal|. In many place you can also use angular brakes to
+further customize the presentation.
+
+In any case make sure you read through the beamer class documentation
+\texttt{beameruserguide.pdf} to get a complete picture of what is in
+store for you. This package is being actively developed, check out their website
+\href{http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/}{http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/}
+to get the latest information.
