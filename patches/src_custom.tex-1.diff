+\subsection{Extra Space}
+
+When creating a new environemnt you may easily get bitten by extra spaces
+creaping in, which can potentially have fatal effects. For example when you
+want to create a title environemnt which supresses its own indentation as
+well as the one on the following paragraph. The \ci{ignorespaces} command in
+the begin block of the environment will make it ignore any space after
+executing the begin block. The end block is a bit more tricky as special
+processing occures at the end of an environment. With the
+\ci{ignorespacesafterend} \LaTeX{} will issue an \ci{ignorespaces} after the
+special `end' processing has occured.
+
+\begin{example}
+\newenvironment{simple}%
+ {\noindent}%
+ {\par\noindent}
+
+\begin{simple}
+See the space\\to the left.
+\end{simple}
+Same\\here.
+\end{example}
+
+\begin{example}
+\newenvironment{correct}%
+ {\noindent\ignorespaces}%
+ {\par\noindent\ignorespacesafterend}
+
+\begin{correct}
+No space\\to the left.
+\end{correct}
+Same\\here.
+\end{example}

+\subsection{Commandline \LaTeX}
+
+If you work on a Unix like OS, you might be using Makefiles to build your
+\LaTeX{} projects. In that connection it might be interesting to produce
+different versions of the same document by calling \LaTeX{} with commandline
+parameters. If you add the following structure to your document:
+
+\begin{verbatim}
+\usepackage{ifthen}
+\ifthenelse{\equal{\blackandwhite}{true}}{
+  % "black and white" mode; do something..
+}{
+  % "color" mode; do something different..
+}
+\end{verbatim}
+
+Now you can call \LaTeX{} like this:
+\begin{verbatim}
+latex '\newcommand{\blackandwhite}{true}\input{test.tex}'
+\end{verbatim}
+
+First the command \verb|\blackandwhite| gets defined and then the actual file is read with input.
+By setting \verb|\blackandwhite| to fals the color version of the document would be produced.
+
 \subsection{Your Own Package}
 
 If you define a lot of new environments and commands, the preamble of
