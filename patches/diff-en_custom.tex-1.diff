+> \subsection{Extra Space}
+> 
+> When creating a new environment you may easily get bitten by extra spaces
+> creeping in, which can potentially have fatal effects. For example when you
+> want to create a title environment which supresses its own indentation as
+> well as the one on the following paragraph. The \ci{ignorespaces} command in
+> the begin block of the environment will make it ignore any space after
+> executing the begin block. The end block is a bit more tricky as special
+> processing occurs at the end of an environment. With the
+> \ci{ignorespacesafterend} \LaTeX{} will issue an \ci{ignorespaces} after the
+> special `end' processing has occured.
+> 
+> \begin{example}
+> \newenvironment{simple}%
+>  {\noindent}%
+>  {\par\noindent}
+> 
+> \begin{simple}
+> See the space\\to the left.
+> \end{simple}
+> Same\\here.
+> \end{example}
+> 
+> \begin{example}
+> \newenvironment{correct}%
+>  {\noindent\ignorespaces}%
+>  {\par\noindent%
+>    \ignorespacesafterend}
+> 
+> \begin{correct}
+> No space\\to the left.
+> \end{correct}
+> Same\\here.
+> \end{example}
+> 
+> \subsection{Commandline \LaTeX}
+> 
+> If you work on a Unix like OS, you might be using Makefiles to build your
+> \LaTeX{} projects. In that connection it might be interesting to produce
+> different versions of the same document by calling \LaTeX{} with commandline
+> parameters. If you add the following structure to your document:
+> 
+> \begin{verbatim}
+> \usepackage{ifthen}
+> \ifthenelse{\equal{\blackandwhite}{true}}{
+>   % "black and white" mode; do something..
+> }{
+>   % "color" mode; do something different..
+> }
+> \end{verbatim}
+> 
+> Now you can call \LaTeX{} like this:
+> \begin{verbatim}
+> latex '\newcommand{\blackandwhite}{true}\input{test.tex}'
+> \end{verbatim}
+> 
+> First the command \verb|\blackandwhite| gets defined and then the actual file is read with input.
+> By setting \verb|\blackandwhite| to false the color version of the document would be produced.
