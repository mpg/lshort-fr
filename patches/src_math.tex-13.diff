 For formulae running over several lines or for \wi{equation system}s,
 you can use the environments \ei{align} and \verb|align*|
 instead of \texttt{equation} and \texttt{equation*}.\footnote{The \ei{align}
-  environment is from \textsf{amsmath}. A similar environment without \texttt{amsmath}
+  environment is from \textsf{amsmath}. A similar environment without \textsf{amsmath}
   from \LaTeX{} is \ei{eqnarray}, but it is generally not advised to use that
 because of spacing and label inconsistencies.} With \ei{align} each line gets an
 equation number. The \verb|align*| does not number anything.
