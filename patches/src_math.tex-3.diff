+\subsection{Bold Symbols}
+\index{bold symbols}
+
+It is quite difficult to get bold symbols in \LaTeX{}; this is
+probably intentional as amateur typesetters tend to overuse them.  The
+font change command \verb|\mathbf| gives bold letters, but these are
+roman (upright) whereas mathematical symbols are normally italic, and
+furthermore it doesn't work on lower case Greek letters.
+There is a \ci{boldmath} command, but \emph{this can only be used
+outside math mode}. It works for symbols too, though:
+\begin{example}
+$\mu, M \qquad 
+\mathbf{\mu}, \mathbf{M}$
+\qquad \boldmath{$\mu, M$}
+\end{example}
+
+The package \pai{amsbsy} (included by \pai{amsmath}) as well as the
+\pai{bm} from the \texttt{tools} bundle make this much easier as they include
+a \ci{boldsymbol} command:
+
+\begin{example}
+$\mu, M \qquad
+\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{M}$
+\end{example}
