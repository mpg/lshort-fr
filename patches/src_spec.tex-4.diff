 You can produce a \wi{bibliography} with the \ei{thebibliography}
 environment.  Each entry starts with
 \begin{lscommand}
-\ci{bibitem}\verb|{|\emph{marker}\verb|}|
+\ci{bibitem}\verb|[|\emph{label}\verb|]{|\emph{marker}\verb|}|
 \end{lscommand}
 The \emph{marker} is then used to cite the book, article or paper
 within the document.
 \begin{lscommand}
 \ci{cite}\verb|{|\emph{marker}\verb|}|
 \end{lscommand}
-The numbering of the entries is generated automatically.  The
-parameter after the \verb|\begin{thebibliography}| command sets the maximum
-width of these numbers. In the example below, \verb|{99}| tells
-\LaTeX{} to expect that none of the bibliography item numbers will be
-wider than the number 99.
