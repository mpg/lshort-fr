+In German books you often find French quotation marks (\flqq guillemets\frqq).
+German typesetters, however, use them differently. A quote in a German book
+would look like \frqq this\flqq. In the German speaking part of Switzerland,
+typesetters use \flqq guillemets\frqq~the same way the French do.
+
+A major problem arises from the use of commands
+like \verb+\flq+: If you use the OT1 font (which is the default font) the  
+guillemets will look like the math symbol ``$\ll$'', which turns a typesetter's stomach.
+T1 encoded fonts, on the other hand, do contain the required symbols. So if you are using this type
+of quote, make sure you use the T1 encoding. (\verb|\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}|)

+\subsection[Support for Korean]{Support for Korean\footnotemark}\label{support_korean}%
+\footnotetext{%
+Considering a number of issues  Korean \LaTeX{} users
+have to cope with.
+This section was written by Karnes KIM on behalf of the
+Korean lshort translation team. It  was translated into English
+by SHIN Jungshik and shortened by Tobi Oetiker}
+
+To use \LaTeX{} for typesetting  \wi{Korean}, 
+we need to solve three problems: 
+
+\begin{enumerate}
+\item 
+We must be able to 
+edit \wi{Korean input files}.
+Korean input files must be in plain text format, but because Korean
+uses its own character set outside the
+repertoire of US-ASCII, they will look rather strange with a normal ASCII editor.  The two most widely used encodings for
+Korean text files are  EUC-KR and its upward compatible
+extension used in Korean MS-Windows, CP949/Windows-949/UHC.
+In these encodings each US-ASCII character represents its normal ASCII
+character similar to other ASCII compatible encodings such as
+ISO-8859-\textit{x}, EUC-JP,Shift\_JIS, and Big5. On the other hand, Hangul
+syllables, Hanjas (Chinese characters as used in Korea), Hangul Jamos,
+Hirakanas, Katakanas, Greek and Cyrillic characters and other
+symbols and letters drawn from KS~X~1001 are represented by two
+consecutive octets. The first has its MSB set.
+Until mid the 1990's, it took a considerable amount of time and effort to
+set up a Korean-capable environment under a non-localized (non-Korean)
+operating system. 
+You can skim through the now much-outdated \url{http://jshin.net/faq} to get 
+a glimpse of what it was like to use Korean under non-Korean OS in mid-1990's.
+These days all three major operating systems (Mac OS, Unix, Windows) come equipped
+with pretty decent multilingual support and internationalization features
+so that editing Korean text file is not so much of a problem anymore, even
+on non-Korean operating systems.
+
+\item \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} were originally written for
+scripts with no more than 256 characters in their alphabet.
+To make them work for languages with considerably 
+more characters such as
+Korean%,
+ \footnote{Korean Hangul is an alphabetic script with 14 basic consonants
+ and 10 basic vowels (Jamos). Unlike Latin or Cyrillic scripts, the
+ individual characters have to be arranged in rectangular
+ clusters about the same size as Chinese characters. Each cluster
+ represents a syllable. An unlimited number of syllables can be
+ formed out of this finite set of vowels and consonants. Modern Korean
+ orthographic standards (both in South Korea and  North Korea), however,
+ put some restriction on the formation of these clusters.
+ Therefore only a finite the number of  orthographically correct syllables exist.
+ The Korean Character encoding defines individual code points for each of these syllables (KS~X~1001:1998 and KS~X~1002:1992). So Hangul, albeit alphabetic, is
+ treated like the Chinese and Japanese writing systems with tens of thousands of
+ ideographic/logographic characters.  ISO~10646/Unicode offers both ways of
+ representing Hangul used for \emph{modern} Korean by encoding Conjoining
+ Hangul Jamos (alphabets: \url{http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1100.pdf})
+ in addition to encoding all the orthographically allowed Hangul syllables in
+ \emph{modern} Korean (\url{http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UAC00.pdf}).
+ One of the most daunting challenges in Korean typesetting with
+ \LaTeX{} and related typesetting system is supporting Middle Korean---and possibly future Korean---syllables that can be only represented
+ by conjoining Jamos in Unicode. It is hoped that future \TeX{} engines like $\Omega$ and
+ $\Lambda$ will eventually provide solutions to this
+ so that some Korean linguists and historians
+ will defect from MS Word that already has  a pretty good support 
+ for Middle Korean.}
+or Chinese, a subfont mechanism was developed.
+It divides a single CJK fonts with  thousands or tens of thousands of
+glyphs into a set of subfonts with 256 glyphs each. 
+For Korean, there are three widely used packages;  \wi{H\LaTeX}
+by UN~Koaunghi, \wi{h\LaTeX{}p} by CHA~Jaechoon and the \wi{CJK package}
+by Werner~Lemberg.\footnote{% 
+They can be obtained at \texttt{CTAN:/tex-archive/language/korean/HLaTeX/}\\
+   \texttt{CTAN:/tex-archive/language/korean/CJK/} and
+   \texttt{http://knot.kaist.ac.kr/htex/}}
+H\LaTeX{} and h\LaTeX{}p are specific to Korean and provide
+Korean localization on top of the font support.
+They both can process Korean input text files encoded in EUC-KR. H\LaTeX{} can
+even process input files encoded in CP949/Windows-949/UHC and UTF-8
+when used along with $\Lambda$, $\Omega$.
+
+The CJK package is not specific to Korean. It can
+process input files in UTF-8 as well as in various CJK encodings
+including EUC-KR and CP949/Windows-949/UHC, it can be used to typeset documents with
+multilingual content (especially Chinese, Japanese and Korean).
+The CJK package has no Korean localization such as the one offered by H\LaTeX{} and it
+does not come with as many special Korean fonts as H\LaTeX.
+
+\item The ultimate purpose of using typesetting programs like \TeX{}
+and \LaTeX{} is to get documents typeset in an `aesthetically' satisfying way.
+Arguably the most important element in typesetting is  a set of
+well-designed fonts. The H\LaTeX{} distribution
+includes \index{Korean font!UHC font}UHC \textsc{PostScript} fonts 
+of 10
+different families and
+Munhwabu\footnote{Korean Ministry of Culture}
+fonts (TrueType) of 5 different families.
+The CJK package works with a set of fonts used by earlier versions
+of H\LaTeX{} and it can use Bitstream's cyberbit TrueType
+font.
+\end{enumerate}
+
+To use the  H\LaTeX{} package for typesetting your Korean text, put the following
+declaration into the preamble of your document:
+\begin{lscommand}
+\verb+\usepackage{hangul}+
+\end{lscommand}
+
+This command turns the Korean localization on. The headings
+of chapters, sections, subsections, table of content and table of
+figures are all translated into Korean and the formatting of the document
+is changed to follow Korean conventions. 
+The packages also provides automatic ``particle selection.''
+In Korean, there are pairs of post-fix particles 
+grammatically equivalent but different in form. Which 
+of any given pair is correct depends on 
+whether the preceding syllable ends with a  vowel or a consonant.
+(It is a bit more complex than this, but this should give you
+a good picture.)
+Native Korean speakers have no problem picking the right particle, but
+it cannot be determined which particle to use for references and other automatic
+text that will change while you edit the document.
+It 
+takes a painstaking effort to place appropriate particles manually
+every time you add/remove references or simply shuffle  parts
+of your document around.
+H\LaTeX{} relieves its users from this boring and error-prone process.
+
+In case you don't need Korean localization features
+but just want 
+to  typeset Korean text, you can put the following line in the 
+preamble, instead.
+\begin{lscommand}
+\verb+\usepackage{hfont}+
+\end{lscommand}
+
+For more details on typesetting  Korean with H\LaTeX{}, refer to
+the \emph{H\LaTeX{} Guide}.  Check out the web site of the Korean
+\TeX{} User Group (KTUG) at  \url{http://www.ktug.or.kr/}.
+There is also a Korean translation
+of this manual available.

+\section{The Space Between Words}
 
 To get a straight right margin in the output, \LaTeX{} inserts varying
 amounts of space between the words. It inserts slightly more space at
