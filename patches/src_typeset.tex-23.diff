+As of this writing, no free, high quality \textsc{PostScript} versions of the EC fonts are
+available.\footnote{Vladimir Volovich has created the cm-super font bundle
+which covers the entire EC/TC, EC Concrete, EC Bright and LH fonts. It is avalable from \texttt{CTAN:/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super} and is
+included with \TeX{}Live7 and Mik\TeX. Unfortunately these fonts are not
+of the same typographic quality as the normal Type1 renderings of the CM fonts} This causes problems when generating PDF versions of your
+documents---the resulting PDF file will look abysmal on screen. You might
+want to have a look at the \pai{aeguill} package, aka \emph{Almost European
+Computer Modern with Guillemets}, which uses the characters from the original Computer
+Modern font, but rearranges them in the EC order and can thus use the
+excellent type 1 format CM fonts available on most systems. There is also an \pai{ae} package, but it
+does not provide proper rendering of French quotes, aka guillemets (see the section
+on pdf\LaTeX{} on page \pageref{sec:pdftex}).
