+\subsection{The Euro Currency Symbol \texorpdfstring{(\EUR)}{}}
+
+When writing about money these days, you need the euro symbol. Many current
+fonts contain a Euro symbol. After loading the \pai{textcomp} package in the preamble of your document
+\begin{lscommand}
+\ci{usepackage}\verb|{textcomp}| 
+\end{lscommand}
+you can use the command
+\begin{lscommand}
+\ci{texteuro}
+\end{lscommand}
+to access it.
+
+If your font does not provide its own Euro symbol or if you do not like the font's Euro symbol, you have two more choices:
+
+First the \pai{eurosym} package. It provides the official Euro symbol:
+\begin{lscommand}
+\ci{usepackage}\verb|[|\emph{official}\verb|]{eurosym}| 
+\end{lscommand}
+If you prefer a euro symbol that matches your font, use the option
+\texttt{gen} in place of the \texttt{official} option.
+
+The \pai{marvosym} package also provides many different symbols,
+including a Euro, under the name:
+\begin{lscommand}
+\ci{EUR}
+\end{lscommand}
+
+\begin{example}
+The \texteuro{}, the \euro{}
+and the \EUR{} all look
